Chillanwallah!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Where our brothers fought and bled,<br />
O thy name is natural music<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And a dirge above the dead!<br />
Though we have not been defeated,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Though we can&rsquo;t be overcome,<br />
Still, whene&rsquo;er thou art repeated,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; I would fain that grief were dumb.</p>
<p class="poetry">Chillianwallah, Chillianwallah!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis a name so sad and strange,<br />
Like a breeze through midnight harpstrings<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Ringing many a mournful change;<br />
But the wildness and the sorrow<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Have a meaning of their own&mdash;<br />
Oh, whereof no glad to-morrow<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Can relieve the dismal tone!</p>
<p class="poetry">Chillianwallah, Chillianwallah!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis a village dark and low,<br />

<a name="page2"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 2</span>And across
the wintry water<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; He is ready to retreat,<br />
When the carnage and the slaughter<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis a wild and dreary plain,<br />
Strewn with plots of thickest jungle,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Matted with the gory stain.<br />
There the murder-mouthed artillery,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In the deadly ambuscade,<br />
Wrought the thunder of its treachery<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; On the skeleton brigade.</p>
<p class="poetry">Chillianwallah, Chillianwallah!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; When the night set in with rain,<br />
Came the savage plundering devils<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To their work among the slain;<br />
And the wounded and the dying<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In cold blood did share the doom<br />
Of their comrades round them lying,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Stiff in the dead skyless gloom.</p>
<p class="poetry">Chillianwallah, Chillianwallah!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Thou wilt be a doleful chord,<br />
And a mystic note of mourning<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That will need no chiming word;<br />
And that heart will leap with anguish<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Who may understand thee best;<br />
But the hopes of all will languish<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Till thy memory is at rest.</p>

Nancy is off!&rsquo; the farmer cried,<br />
Advancing by the river side,<br />
Red-kerchieft and brown-coated;&mdash;&lsquo;So,<br />
My girl, who else could leap like that?<br />
So neatly! like a lady!&nbsp; &lsquo;Zounds!<br />
Look at her how she leads the hounds!&rsquo;<br />
And waving his dusty beaver hat,<br />
He cheered across the chase-filled water,<br />
And clapt his arm about his daughter,<br />
And gave to Joan a courteous hug,<br />
And kiss that, like a stubborn plug<br />
From generous vats in vastness rounded,<br />
The inner wealth and spirit sounded:<br />
Eagerly pointing South, where, lo,<br />
The daintiest, fleetest-footed doe<br />
Led o&rsquo;er the fields and thro&rsquo; the furze<br />
Beyond: her lively delicate ears<br />
Prickt up erect, and in her track<br />
A dappled lengthy-striding pack.</p>
<p class="poetry">Scarce had they cast eyes upon her,<br />
When every heart was wagered on her,<br />
And half in dread, and half delight,<br />
They watched her lovely bounding flight;<br />
As now across the flashing green,<br />
<a name="page4"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 4</span>And now
beneath the stately trees,<br />
And now far distant in the dene,<br />
She headed on with graceful ease:<br />
Hanging aloft with doubled knees,<br />
At times athwart some hedge or gate;<br />
And slackening pace by slow degrees,<br />
As for the foremost foe to wait.<br />
Renewing her outstripping rate<br />
Whene&rsquo;er the hot pursuers neared,<br />
By garden wall and paled estate,<br />
Where clambering gazers whooped and cheered.<br />
Here winding under elm and oak,<br />
And slanting up the sunny hill:<br />
Splashing the water here like smoke<br />
Among the mill-holms round the mill.</p>
<p class="poetry">And&mdash;&lsquo;Let her go; she shows her
game,<br />
My Nancy girl, my pet and treasure!&rsquo;<br />
The farmer sighed: his eyes with pleasure<br />
Brimming: &lsquo;&rsquo;Tis my daughter&rsquo;s name,<br />
My second daughter lying yonder.&rsquo;<br />
And Willie&rsquo;s eye in search did wander,<br />
And caught at once, with moist regard,<br />
The white gleams of a grey churchyard.<br />
&lsquo;Three weeks before my girl had gone,<br />
And while upon her pillows propped,<br />
She lay at eve; the weakling fawn&mdash;<br />
For still it seems a fawn just dropt<br />
A se&rsquo;nnight&mdash;to my Nancy&rsquo;s bed<br />
I brought to make my girl a gift:<br />
The mothers of them both were dead:<br />
And both to bless it was my drift,<br />
By giving each a friend; not thinking<br />
How rapidly my girl was sinking.<br />
And I remember how, to pat<br />
<a name="page5"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 5</span>Its neck,
she stretched her hand so weak,<br />
And its cold nose against her cheek<br />
Pressed fondly: and I fetched the mat<br />
To make it up a couch just by her,<br />
Where in the lone dark hours to lie:<br />
For neither dear old nurse nor I<br />
Would any single wish deny her.<br />
And there unto the last it lay;<br />
And in the pastures cared to play<br />
Little or nothing: there its meals<br />
And milk I brought: and even now<br />
The creature such affection feels<br />
For that old room that, when and how,<br />
&rsquo;Tis strange to mark, it slinks and steals<br />
To get there, and all day conceals.<br />
And once when nurse who, since that time,<br />
Keeps house for me, was very sick,<br />
Waking upon the midnight chime,<br />
And listening to the stair-clock&rsquo;s click,<br />
I heard a rustling, half uncertain,<br />
Close against the dark bed-curtain:<br />
And while I thrust my leg to kick,<br />
And feel the phantom with my feet,<br />
A loving tongue began to lick<br />
My left hand lying on the sheet;<br />
And warm sweet breath upon me blew,<br />
And that &rsquo;twas Nancy then I knew.<br />
So, for her love, I had good cause<br />
To have the creature &ldquo;Nancy&rdquo; christened.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">He paused, and in the moment&rsquo;s pause,<br
/>
His eyes and Willie&rsquo;s strangely glistened.<br />
Nearer came Joan, and Bessy hung<br />
With face averted, near enough<br />
To hear, and sob unheard; the young<br />
<a name="page6"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 6</span>And careless
ones had scampered off<br />
Meantime, and sought the loftiest place<br />
To beacon the approaching chase.</p>
<p class="poetry">&lsquo;Daily upon the meads to browse,<br />
Goes Nancy with those dairy cows<br />
You see behind the clematis:<br />
And such a favourite she is,<br />
That when fatigued, and helter skelter,<br />
Among them from her foes to shelter,<br />
She dashes when the chase is over,<br />
They&rsquo;ll close her in and give her cover,<br />
And bend their horns against the hounds,<br />
And low, and keep them out of bounds!<br />
From the house dogs she dreads no harm,<br />
And is good friends with all the farm,<br />
Man, and bird, and beast, howbeit<br />
Their natures seem so opposite.<br />
And she is known for many a mile,<br />
And noted for her splendid style,<br />
For her clear leap and quick slight hoof;<br />
Welcome she is in many a roof.<br />
And if I say, I love her, man!<br />
I say but little: her fine eyes full<br />
Of memories of my girl, at Yule<br />
And May-time, make her dearer than<br />
Dumb brute to men has been, I think.<br />
So dear I do not find her dumb.<br />
I know her ways, her slightest wink,<br />
So well; and to my hand she&rsquo;ll come,<br />
Sidelong, for food or a caress,<br />
Just like a loving human thing.<br />
Nor can I help, I do confess,<br />
Some touch of human sorrowing<br />
To think there may be such a doubt<br />
<a name="page7"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 7</span>That from
the next world she&rsquo;ll be shut out,<br />
And parted from me!&nbsp; And well I mind<br />
How, when my girl&rsquo;s last moments came,<br />
Her soft eyes very soft and kind,<br />
She joined her hands and prayed the same,<br />
That she &ldquo;might meet her father, mother,<br />
Sister Bess, and each dear brother,<br />
And with them, if it might be, one<br />
Who was her last companion.&rdquo;<br />
Meaning the fawn&mdash;the doe you mark&mdash;<br />
For my bay mare was then a foal,<br />
And time has passed since then:&mdash;but hark!&rsquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">For like the shrieking of a soul<br />
Shut in a tomb, a darkened cry<br />
Of inward-wailing agony<br />
Surprised them, and all eyes on each<br />
Fixed in the mute-appealing speech<br />
Of self-reproachful apprehension:<br />
Knowing not what to think or do:<br />
But Joan, recovering first, broke through<br />
The instantaneous suspension,<br />
And knelt upon the ground, and guessed<br />
The bitterness at a glance, and pressed<br />
Into the comfort of her breast<br />
The deep-throed quaking shape that drooped<br />
In misery&rsquo;s wilful aggravation,<br />
Before the farmer as he stooped,<br />
Touched with accusing consternation:<br />
Soothing her as she sobbed aloud:&mdash;<br />
<a name="page8"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 8</span>&lsquo;Not
me! not me!&nbsp; Oh, no, no, no!<br />
Not me!&nbsp; God will not take me in!<br />
Nothing can wipe away my sin!<br />
I shall not see her: you will go;<br />
You and all that she loves so:<br />
Not me! not me!&nbsp; Oh, no, no, no!&rsquo;<br />
Colourless, her long black hair,<br />
Like seaweed in a tempest tossed<br />
Tangling astray, to Joan&rsquo;s care<br />
She yielded like a creature lost:<br />
Yielded, drooping toward the ground,<br />
As doth a shape one half-hour drowned,<br />
And heaved from sea with mast and spar,<br />
All dark of its immortal star.<br />
And on that tender heart, inured<br />
To flatter basest grief, and fight<br />
Despair upon the brink of night,<br />
She suffered herself to sink, assured<br />
Of refuge; and her ear inclined<br />
To comfort; and her thoughts resigned<br />
To counsel; her wild hair let brush<br />
From off her weeping brows; and shook<br />
With many little sobs that took<br />
Deeper-drawn breaths, till into sighs,<br />
Long sighs, they sank; and to the &lsquo;hush!&rsquo;<br />
Of Joan&rsquo;s gentle chide, she sought<br />
Childlike to check them as she ought,<br />
Looking up at her infantwise.<br />
And Willie, gazing on them both,<br />
Shivered with bliss through blood and brain,<br />
To see the darling of his troth<br />
Like a maternal angel strain<br />
The sinful and the sinless child<br />
At once on either breast, and there<br />
In peace and promise reconciled<br />
Unite them: nor could Nature&rsquo;s care<br />
With subtler sweet beneficence<br />
Have fed the springs of penitence,<br />
Still keeping true, though harshly tried,<br />
The vital prop of human pride.</p>

Whispering the breeze, and wedding the rich air<br />

73</span>SONG</h2>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">Under</span> boughs of
breathing May,<br />
In the mild spring-time I lay,<br />
Lonely, for I had no love;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And the sweet birds all sang for

&nbsp;&nbsp; Cuckoo, lark, and dove.</p>
<p class="poetry">Tell me, cuckoo, then I cried,<br />
Dare I woo and wed a bride?<br />
I, like thee, have no home-nest;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And the twin notes thus tuned
their ditty,&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &lsquo;Love can answer best.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">Nor, warm dove with tender coo,<br />
Have I thy soft voice to woo,<br />
Even were a damsel by;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And the deep woodland crooned its
ditty,&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &lsquo;Love her first and try.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">Nor have I, wild lark, thy wing,<br />
That from bluest heaven can bring<br />
Bliss, whatever fate befall;<br />

ditty,&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &lsquo;Love will give thee all.&rsquo;</p>

Wooing well with fervent song,<br />
I had won a damsel coy;<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp; Jubileed for joy.</p>

Heedless of heat, and the hot-kissing sun, and the fear of dark

Mute with the cares of the nest; only known by a &lsquo;chuck,
chuck,&rsquo; and dovelike<br />

There, by the wet-mirrored osiers, the emerald wing of the

buried.<br />
Saying: to-morrow, to-morrow, few hours intervening, that

The bliss above, the reverence below,<br />

Thou wouldst at once with holy ecstasy<br />
Give thy warm limbs into the yearning earth.<br />
Sleep, Sister! for Elysium&rsquo;s dawning birth,&mdash;<br />

Sleep, for the Gods are watching over thee!<br />
Thy dream will steer thee to perform their will,<br />

O Sister! in the sweetness of thy prime,<br />
Thy hand has plucked the bitter flower of death;<br />
But this will dower thee with Elysian breath,<br />

Dear to the Gods are those that do like thee<br />
A solemn duty! for the tyranny<br />

Defy them to fulfil its sacred cares:<br />
And weak against a mighty will are men.<br />
O, Torch between two brothers! in whose gleam<br />
Our slaughtered House doth shine as one again,<br />
Tho&rsquo; severed by the sword; now may thy dream<br />
Kindle desire in thee for us, and thou,<br />
Forgetting not thy lover and his vow,<br />
Leaving no human memory forgot,<br />
Shalt cross, not unattended, the dark stream<br />
Which runs by thee in sleep and ripples not.<br />

So do thy kindred spirits wait for thee.<br />
O Sister! soft as on the downward rill,<br />
Will those first daybeams from the distant hill<br />
Fall on the smoothness of thy placid brow,<br />
Like this calm sweetness breathing thro&rsquo; me now:<br />
And when the fated sounds shall wake thine eyes,<br />
Wilt thou, confiding in the supreme will,<br />
In all thy maiden steadfastness arise,<br />
Firm to obey and earnest to fulfil;<br />
Remembering the night thou didst not sleep,<br />
And this same brooding sky beheld thee creep,<br />
Defiant of unnatural decree,<br />
To where I lay upon the outcast land;<br />
Before the iron gates upon the plain;<br />
A wretched, graveless ghost, whose wailing chill<br />
Came to thy darkened door imploring thee;<br />
Yearning for burial like my brother slain;&mdash;<br />
And all was dared for love and piety!<br />
This thought will nerve again thy virgin hand<br />
To serve its purpose and its destiny.&rsquo;</p>

SHIPWRECK OF IDOMENEUS</h2>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">Swept</span> from his fleet
upon that fatal night<br />
When great Poseidon&rsquo;s sudden-veering wrath<br />
Scattered the happy homeward-floating Greeks<br />
Like foam-flakes off the waves, the King of Crete<br />
Held lofty commune with the dark Sea-god.<br />
His brows were crowned with victory, his cheeks<br />
Were flushed with triumph, but the mighty joy<br />
Of Troy&rsquo;s destruction and his own great deeds<br />
Passed, for the thoughts of home were dearer now,<br />
And sweet the memory of wife and child,<br />
And weary now the ten long, foreign years,<br />
And terrible the doubt of short delay&mdash;<br />
More terrible, O Gods! he cried, but stopped;<br />
Then raised his voice upon the storm and prayed.<br />
O thou, if injured, injured not by me,<br />
Poseidon! whom sea-deities obey<br />
And mortals worship, hear me! for indeed<br />
It was our oath to aid the cause of Greece,<br />
Not unespoused by Gods, and most of all<br />
By thee, if gentle currents, havens calm,<br />
Fair winds and prosperous voyage, and the Shape<br />
Impersonate in many a perilous hour,<br />
Both in the stately councils of the Kings,<br />
And when the husky battle murmured thick,<br />
May testify of services performed!<br />
But now the seas are haggard with thy wrath,<br />
Thy breath is tempest! never at the shores<br />
<a name="page101"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 101</span>Of
hostile Ilium did thy stormful brows<br />
Betray such fierce magnificence! not even<br />
On that wild day when, mad with torch and glare,<br />
The frantic crowds with eyes like starving wolves<br />
Burst from their ports impregnable, a stream<br />
Of headlong fury toward the hissing deep;<br />
Where then full-armed I stood in guard, compact<br />
Beside thee, and alone, with brand and spear,<br />
We held at bay the swarming brood, and poured<br />
Blood of choice warriors on the foot-ploughed sands!<br />
Thou, meantime, dark with conflict, as a cloud<br />
That thickens in the bosom of the West<br />
Over quenched sunset, circled round with flame,<br />
Huge as a billow running from the winds<br />
Long distances, till with black shipwreck swoln,<br />
It flings its angry mane about the sky.<br />
And like that billow heaving ere it burst;<br />
And like that cloud urged by impulsive storm<br />
With charge of thunder, lightning, and the drench<br />
Of torrents, thou in all thy majesty<br />
Of mightiness didst fall upon the war!<br />
Remember that great moment!&nbsp; Nor forget<br />
The aid I gave thee; how my ready spear<br />
Flew swiftly seconding thy mortal stroke,<br />
Where&rsquo;er the press was hottest; never slacked<br />

Lustrous with sunlight, by the still increase<br />
Of heat to glowing heat conceives like zeal<br />
Of radiance, till at the pitch of noon<br />

Horridly over leagues of doom&rsquo;d domain;<br />
Mingling the screams of birds, the cries of brutes,<br />
The wail of creatures in the covert pent,<br />
<a name="page102"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 102</span>Howls,
yells, and shrieks of agony, the hiss<br />
Of seething sap, and crash of falling boughs<br />

Savage with phantasies of victory,<br />
A sea of dusky shapes; for day had passed<br />
And night fell on their darkened faces, red<br />
With fight and torchflare; shrill the resonant air<br />
With eager shouts, and hoarse with angry groans;<br />
While over all the dense and sullen boom,<br />
The din and murmur of the myriads,<br />
Rolled with its awful intervals, as though<br />
The battle breathed, or as against the shore<br />
Waves gather back to heave themselves anew.<br />
That night sleep dropped not from the dreary skies,<br />
Nor could the prowess of our chiefs oppose<br />
That sea of raging men.&nbsp; But what were they?<br />

Are wrecks, himself the drowning, drifting weed<br />
That wanders on thy waters; such as I<br />
Who see the scattered remnants of my fleet,<br />
Remembering the day when first we sailed,<br />
Each glad ship shining like the morning star<br />
With promise for the world.&nbsp; Oh! such as I<br />
Thus darkly drifting on the drowning waves.<br />
O God of waters! &rsquo;tis a dreadful thing<br />
To suffer for an evil unrevealed;<br />
Dreadful it is to hear the perishing cry<br />
Of those we love; the silence that succeeds<br />
How dreadful!&nbsp; Still my trust is fixed on thee<br />
For those that still remain and for myself.<br />
And if I hear thy swift foam-snorting steeds<br />
Drawing thy dusky chariot, as in<br />
The pauses of the wind I seem to hear,<br />
Deaf thou art not to my entreating prayer!<br />

My Queen, my pretty nursling of five years,<br />

Of marriage, and our brightest prize of love,<br />
Whose parting cry rings clearest in my heart.<br />
O lay this horror, much-offended God!<br />
And making all as fair and firm as when<br />
We trusted to thy mighty depths of old,&mdash;<br />

Conscious of that divine debate, withheld<br />
Its fierce emotion, in the luminous gloom<br />
Of those so dark irradiating eyes!<br />
Beneath whose wavering lustre shone revealed<br />
The tumult of the purpling deeps, and all<br />
The throbbing of the tempest, as it paused,<br />
<a name="page104"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 104</span>Slowly
subsiding, seeming to await<br />
The sudden signal, as a faithful hound<br />
Pants with the forepaws stretched before its nose,<br />
Athwart the greensward, after an eager chase;<br />
Its hot tongue thrust to cool, its foamy jaws<br />
Open to let the swift breath come and go,<br />
Its quick interrogating eyes fixed keen<br />
Upon the huntsman&rsquo;s countenance, and ever<br />
Lashing its sharp impatient tail with haste:<br />
Prompt at the slightest sign to scour away,<br />
And hang itself afresh by the bleeding fangs,<br />
Upon the neck of some death-singled stag,<br />
Whose royal antlers, eyes, and stumbling knees<br />
Will supplicate the Gods in mute despair.<br />
This time not mute, nor yet in vain this time!<br />
For still the burden of the earnest voice<br />
And all the vivid glories it revoked<br />
Sank in the God, with that absorbed suspense<br />
Felt only by the Olympians, whose minds<br />
Unbounded like our mortal brain, perceive<br />
All things complete, the end, the aim of all;<br />
To whom the crown and consequence of deeds<br />
Are ever present with the deed itself.</p>
<p class="poetry">And now the pouring surges, vast and smooth,<br

Grew weary of restraint, and heaved themselves<br />
Headlong beneath him, breaking at his feet<br />
With wild importunate cries and angry wail;<br />
Like crowds that shout for bread and hunger more.<br />
And now the surface of their rolling backs<br />
Was ridged with foam-topt furrows, rising high<br />
And dashing wildly, like to fiery steeds,<br />
Fresh from the Thracian or Thessalian plains,<br />
High-blooded mares just tempering to the bit,<br />
Whose manes at full-speed stream upon the winds,<br />

Were fit to follow in their flashing track.<br />
Anon with gathering stature to the height<br />
Of those colossal giants, doomed long since<br />
To torturous grief and penance, that assailed<br />
The sky-throned courts of Zeus, and climbing, dared<br />
For once in a world the Olympic wrath, and braved<br />
The electric spirit which from his clenching hand<br />
Pierces the dark-veined earth, and with a touch<br />
Is death to mortals, fearfully they grew!<br />
And with like purpose of audacity<br />
Threatened Titanic fury to the God.<br />
Such was the agitation of the sea<br />
Beneath Poseidon&rsquo;s thought-revolving brows,<br />
Storming for signal.&nbsp; But no signal came.<br />
And as when men, who congregate to hear<br />
Some proclamation from the regal fount,<br />
With eager questioning and anxious phrase<br />
Betray the expectation of their hearts,<br />
Till after many hours of fretful sloth,<br />
Weary with much delay, they hold discourse<br />
In sullen groups and cloudy masses, stirred<br />
With rage irresolute and whispering plot,<br />
Known more by indication than by word,<br />
And understood alone by those whose minds<br />
Participate;&mdash;even so the restless waves<br />
Began to lose all sense of servitude,<br />

His brows resumed the grandeur of their ire;<br />
Throughout his vast divinity the deeps<br />
Concurrent thrilled with action, and away,<br />
As sweeps a thunder-cloud across the sky<br />
In harvest-time, preluded by dull blasts;<br />
Or some black-visaged whirlwind, whose wide folds<br />
Rush, wrestling on with all &rsquo;twixt heaven and earth,<br />
Darkling he hurried, and his distant voice,<br />
Not softened by delay, was heard in tones<br />
Distinctly terrible, still following up<br />
Its rapid utterance of tremendous wrath<br />
With hoarse reverberations; like the roar<br />
Of lions when they hunger, and awake<br />
The sullen echoes from their forest sleep,<br />
To speed the ravenous noise from hill to hill<br />
And startle victims; but more awful, He,<br />
Scudding across the hills that rise and sink,<br />
With foam, and splash, and cataracts of spray,<br />
Clothed in majestic splendour; girt about<br />
With Sea-gods and swift creatures of the sea;<br />
Their briny eyes blind with the showering drops;<br />
Their stormy locks, salt tongues, and scaly backs,<br />
Quivering in harmony with the tempest, fierce<br />
And eager with tempestuous delight;&mdash;<br />
He like a moving rock above them all<br />
Solemnly towering while fitful gleams<br />
Brake from his dense black forehead, which display&rsquo;d<br />
The enduring chiefs as their distracted fleets<br />
Tossed, toiling with the waters, climbing high,<br />
And plunging downward with determined beaks,<br />
In lurid anguish; but the Cretan king<br />
And all his crew were &rsquo;ware of under-tides,<br />
That for the groaning vessel made a path,<br />
<a name="page107"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 107</span>On which
the impending and precipitous waves<br />
Fell not, nor suck&rsquo;d to their abysmal gorge.</p>
<p class="poetry">O, happy they to feel the mighty God,<br />
Without his whelming presence near: to feel<br />
Safety and sweet relief from such despair,<br />
And gushing of their weary hopes once more<br />
Within their fond warm hearts, tired limbs, and eyes<br />
Heavy with much fatigue and want of sleep!<br />
Prayers did not lack; like mountain springs they came,<br />
After the earth has drunk the drenching rains,<br />
And throws her fresh-born jets into the sun<br />
With joyous sparkles;&mdash;for there needed not<br />
Evidence more serene of instant grace,<br />
Immortal mercy! and the sense which follows<br />
Divine interposition, when the shock<br />
Of danger hath been thwarted by the Gods,<br />
Visibly, and through supplication deep,&mdash;<br />
Rose in them, chiefly in the royal mind<br />
Of him whose interceding vow had saved.<br />
Tears from that great heroic soul sprang up;<br />
Not painful as in grief, nor smarting keen<br />
With shame of weeping; but calm, fresh, and sweet;<br />
Such as in lofty spirits rise, and wed<br />
The nature of the woman to the man;<br />
A sight most lovely to the Gods!&nbsp; They fell<br />
Like showers of starlight from his steadfast eyes,<br />
As ever towards the prow he gazed, nor moved<br />
One muscle, with firm lips and level lids,<br />
Motionless; while the winds sang in his ears,<br />
And took the length of his brown hair in streams<br />
Behind him.&nbsp; Thus the hours passed, and the oars<br />
Plied without pause, and nothing but the sound<br />
Of the dull rowlocks and still watery sough,<br />
Far off, the carnage of the storm, was heard.<br />
<a name="page108"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 108</span>For
nothing spake the mariners in their toil,<br />
And all the captains of the war were dumb:<br />
Too much oppressed with wonder, too much thrilled<br />
By their great chieftain&rsquo;s silence, to disturb<br />
Such meditation with poor human speech.<br />
Meantime the moon through slips of driving cloud<br />
Came forth, and glanced athwart the seas a path<br />
Of dusky splendour, like the Hadean brows,<br />
When with Elysian passion they behold<br />
Persephone&rsquo;s complacent hueless cheeks.<br />
Soon gathering strength and lustre, as a ship<br />
That swims into some blue and open bay<br />
With bright full-bosomed sails, the radiant car<br />
Of Artemis advanced, and on the waves<br />
Sparkled like arrows from her silver bow<br />
The keenness of her pure and tender gaze.</p>
<p class="poetry">Then, slowly, one by one the chiefs sought
rest;<br />
The watches being set, and men to relieve<br />
The rowers at midseason.&nbsp; Fair it was<br />
To see them as they lay!&nbsp; Some up the prow,<br />
Some round the helm, in open-handed sleep;<br />
With casques unloosed, and bucklers put aside;<br />
The ten years&rsquo; tale of war upon their cheeks,<br />
Where clung the salt wet locks, and on their breasts<br />
Beards, the thick growth of many a proud campaign;<br />
And on their brows the bright invisible crown<br />
Victory sheds from her own radiant form,<br />
As o&rsquo;er her favourites&rsquo; heads she sings and soars.<br
/>
But dreams came not so calmly; as around<br />
Turbulent shores wild waves and swamping surf<br />
Prevail, while seaward, on the tranquil deeps,<br />
Reign placid surfaces and solemn peace,<br />
So, from the troubled strands of memory, they<br />
Launched and were tossed, long ere they found the tides<br />
<a name="page109"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 109</span>That
lead to the gentle bosoms of pure rest.<br />
And like to one who from a ghostly watch<br />
In a lone house where murder hath been done,<br />
And secret violations, pale with stealth<br />
Emerges, staggering on the first chill gust<br />
Wherewith the morning greets him, feeling not<br />
Its balmy freshness on his bloodless cheek,&mdash;<br />
But swift to hide his midnight face afar,<br />
&rsquo;Mongst the old woods and timid-glancing flowers<br />
Hastens, till on the fresh reviving breasts<br />
Of tender Dryads folded he forgets<br />
The pallid witness of those nameless things,<br />
In renovated senses lapt, and joins<br />
The full, keen joyance of the day, so they<br />
From sights and sounds of battle smeared with blood,<br />
And shrieking souls on Acheron&rsquo;s bleak tides,<br />
And wail of execrating kindred, slid<br />
Into oblivious slumber and a sense<br />
Of satiate deliciousness complete.</p>
<p class="poetry">Leave them, O Muse, in that so happy sleep!<br

Leave them to reap the harvest of their toil,<br />
While fast in moonlight the glad vessel glides,<br />
As if instinctive to its forest home.<br />
O Muse, that in all sorrows and all joys,<br />
Rapturous bliss and suffering divine,<br />
Dwellest with equal fervour, in the calm<br />
Of thy serene philosophy, albeit<br />
Thy gentle nature is of joy alone,<br />
And loves the pipings of the happy fields,<br />
Better than all the great parade and pomp<br />
Which forms the train of heroes and of kings,<br />
And sows, too frequently, the tragic seeds<br />
That choke with sobs thy singing,&mdash;turn away<br />
Thy lustrous eyes back to the oath-bound man!<br />
<a name="page110"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 110</span>For as a
shepherd stands above his flock,<br />
The lofty figure of the king is seen,<br />
Standing above his warriors as they sleep:<br />
And still as from a rock grey waters gush,<br />
While still the rock is passionless and dark,<br />
Nor moves one feature of its giant face,<br />
The tears fall from his eyes, and he stirs not.</p>
<p class="poetry">And O, bright Muse! forget not thou to fold<br
/>
In thy prophetic sympathy the thought<br />
Of him whose destiny has heard its doom:<br />
The Sacrifice thro&rsquo; whom the ship is saved.<br />
Haply that Sacrifice is sleeping now,<br />
And dreams of glad tomorrows.&nbsp; Haply now,<br />
His hopes are keenest, and his fervent blood<br />
Richest with youth, and love, and fond regard!<br />
Round him the circle of affections blooms,<br />
And in some happy nest of home he lives,<br />
One name oft uttering in delighted ears,<br />
Mother! at which the heart of men are kin<br />
With reverence and yearning.&nbsp; Haply, too,<br />
That other name, twin holy, twin revered,<br />
He whispers often to the passing winds<br />
That blow toward the Asiatic coasts;<br />
For Crete has sent her bravest to the war,<br />
And multitudes pressed forward to that rank,<br />
Men with sad weeping wives and little ones.<br />
That other name&mdash;O Father! who art thou,<br />
Thus doomed to lose the star of thy last days?<br />
It may be the sole flower of thy life,<br />
And that of all who now look up to thee!<br />
O Father, Father! unto thee even now<br />
Fate cries; the future with imploring voice<br />
Cries &lsquo;Save me,&rsquo; &lsquo;Save me,&rsquo; though thou
hearest not.<br />
And O thou Sacrifice, foredoomed by Zeus;<br />
<a name="page111"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 111</span>Even now
the dark inexorable deed<br />
Is dealing its relentless stroke, and vain<br />
Are prayers, and tears, and struggles, and despair!<br />
The mother&rsquo;s tears, the nation&rsquo;s stormful grief,<br

The people&rsquo;s indignation and revenge!<br />
Vain the last childlike pleading voice for life,<br />

A sweeter song, a dearer ditty;<br />
Ouzel and throstle, new-mated and gay,<br />
Singing their bridals on every spray&mdash;<br />
Oh, hear them, deep in the songless City!<br />
Cast off the yoke of toil and smoke,<br />
As Spring is casting winter&rsquo;s grey,<br />
As serpents cast their skins away:<br />
And come, for the Country awaits thee with pity<br />
And longs to bathe thee in her delight,<br />
And take a new joy in thy kindling sight;<br />
And I no less, by day and night,<br />
Long for thy coming, and watch for, and wait thee,<br />
And wonder what duties can thus berate thee.</p>
<p class="poetry">Dry-fruited firs are dropping their cones,<br

And vista&rsquo;d avenues of pines<br />
Take richer green, give fresher tones,<br />
As morn after morn the glad sun shines.</p>
<p class="poetry">Primrose tufts peep over the brooks,<br />
Fair faces amid moist decay!<br />
The rivulets run with the dead leaves at play,<br />
The leafless elms are alive with the rooks.</p>

And her blue eye the brighter the more it may weep:<br />
The frog and the butterfly wake from their sleep,<br />
Each to its element, water and air.</p>
<p class="poetry">Mist hangs still on every hill,<br />
And curls up the valleys at eve; but noon<br />
Is fullest of Spring; and at midnight the moon<br />
Gives her westering throne to Orion&rsquo;s bright zone,<br />
As he slopes o&rsquo;er the darkened world&rsquo;s repose;<br />
And a lustre in eastern Sirius glows.</p>
<p class="poetry">Come, in the season of opening buds;<br />
Come, and molest not the otter that whistles<br />
Unlit by the moon, &rsquo;mid the wet winter bristles<br />
Of willow, half-drowned in the fattening floods.<br />
Let him catch his cold fish without fear of a gun,<br />
And the stars shall shield him, and thou wilt shun!<br />
And every little bird under the sun<br />
Shall know that the bounty of Spring doth dwell<br />
In the winds that blow, in the waters that run,<br />
And in the breast of man as well.</p>

By Arthur&rsquo;s knights in scorn God-sped:&mdash;<br />
How think you he felt?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; O the bride within<br />
Was yellow and dry as a snake&rsquo;s old skin;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Loathly as sin!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Scarcely faceable,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Quite unembraceable;<br />
With a hog&rsquo;s bristle on a hag&rsquo;s chin!&mdash;<br />
Gentle Gawain felt as should we,<br />
Little of Love&rsquo;s soft fire knew he:<br />
But he was the Knight of Courtesy.</p>
<h3>II</h3>
<p class="poetry">When that evil lady he lay beside<br />
Bade him turn to greet his bride,<br />
What think you he did?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; O, to spare her pain,<br />
And let not his loathing her loathliness vain<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mirror too plain,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sadly, sighingly,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Almost dyingly,<br />
Turned he and kissed her once and again.<br />
Like Sir Gawain, gentles, should we?<br />

There&rsquo;s none like the Knight of Courtesy.</p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Beauty her dower!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Breathing perfumingly;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Shall I live bloomingly,<br />
Said she, by day, or the bridal hour?<br />
Thereat he clasped her, and whispered he,<br />
Thine, rare bride, the choice shall be.<br />
Said she, Twice blest is Courtesy!</p>

so still?<br />

Yes, my old girl! and it&rsquo;s no use crying:<br />

MEETING</h2>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">The</span> old coach-road
through a common of furze,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With knolls of pine, ran white;<br />
Berries of autumn, with thistles, and burrs,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And spider-threads, droop&rsquo;d in the light.</p>
<p class="poetry">The light in a thin blue veil peered sick;<br

&nbsp;&nbsp; The sheep grazed close and still;<br />
The smoke of a farm by a yellow rick<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Curled lazily under a hill.</p>
<p class="poetry">No fly shook the round of the silver net;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; No insect the swift bird chased;<br />
Only two travellers moved and met<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Across that hazy waste.</p>
<p class="poetry">One was a girl with a babe that throve,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Her ruin and her bliss;<br />
One was a youth with a lawless love,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Who clasped it the more for this.</p>

<h3>I</h3>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">Now</span>, this, to my
notion, is pleasant cheer,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To lie all alone on a ragged heath,<br />
Where your nose isn&rsquo;t sniffing for bones or beer,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; But a peat-fire smells like a garden beneath.<br />
The cottagers bustle about the door,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And the girl at the window ties her strings.<br />
She&rsquo;s a dish for a man who&rsquo;s a mind to be poor;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Lord! women are such expensive things.</p>
<h3>II</h3>
<p class="poetry">We don&rsquo;t marry beggars, says she: why,
no:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; It seems that to make &rsquo;em is what you do;<br

And as I can cook, and scour, and sew,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; I needn&rsquo;t pay half my victuals for you.<br />
A man for himself should be able to scratch,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; But tickling&rsquo;s a luxury:&mdash;love,
indeed!<br />
Love burns as long as the lucifer match,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Wedlock&rsquo;s the candle!&nbsp; Now, that&rsquo;s
my creed.</p>
<h3>III</h3>
<p class="poetry">The church-bells sound water-like over the
wheat;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And up the long path troop pair after pair.<br />

<p class="poetry">You nice little madam! you know you&rsquo;re

You&rsquo;re a plateful of vanity pepper&rsquo;d with vice;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; You chap at the gate thinks t&rsquo; other way.<br
/>
On his waistcoat you read both his head and his heart:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; There&rsquo;s a whole week&rsquo;s wages there
figured in gold!<br />
Yes! when you turn round you may well give a start:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; It&rsquo;s fun to a fellow who&rsquo;s getting
old.</p>
<h3>V</h3>
<p class="poetry">Now, that&rsquo;s a good craft, weaving
waistcoats and flowers,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And selling of ribbons, and scenting of lard:<br />
It gives you a house to get in from the showers,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And food when your appetite jockeys you hard.<br />
You live a respectable man; but I ask<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; If it&rsquo;s worth the trouble?&nbsp; You use your
tools,<br />
And spend your time, and what&rsquo;s your task?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Why, to make a slide for a couple of fools.</p>

&nbsp;&nbsp; To myself I&rsquo;m in tune: I hope you&rsquo;re as

You jolly old cot! though you don&rsquo;t own coal:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; It&rsquo;s a generous pot that&rsquo;s boiled with
peat.<br />
Let the Lord Mayor o&rsquo; London roast oxen whole:<br />

I talk o&rsquo; the Lord Mayor o&rsquo; London because<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; I once was on intimate terms with his cook.<br />
I served him a turn, and got pensioned on scraps,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And, Lord, Sir! didn&rsquo;t I envy his place,<br />

refuse?<br />
That stopping old custom wakes my spleen:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The poor and the rich both in giving agree:<br />
Your tight-fisted shopman&rsquo;s the Radical mean:<br />

On week-days he&rsquo;s playing at Spider and Fly,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And on Sundays he sings about Cherubim!<br />
Nailing shillings to counters is his chief work:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; He nods now and then at the name on his door:<br />
But judge of us two, at a bow and a smirk,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; I think I&rsquo;m his match: and I&rsquo;m
honest&mdash;that&rsquo;s more.</p>

&nbsp;&nbsp; He can&rsquo;t enjoy! all but cash he hates.<br />
He&rsquo;s only a snail that crawls under his shop;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Though he has got the ear o&rsquo; the

<h3>XI</h3>
<p class="poetry">Now, giving and taking&rsquo;s a proper

But buying and selling seems always strange;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; You&rsquo;re hostile, and that&rsquo;s the thing

It&rsquo;s man against man&mdash;you&rsquo;re almost brutes;<br

&nbsp;&nbsp; I remember a girl in London streets:<br />
She stood by a coffee-stall, nice and hot,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; My belly was like a lamb that bleats.<br />
Says I to myself, as her shilling I seized,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; You haven&rsquo;t a character here, my dear!<br />
But for making a rascal like me so pleased,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll give you one, in a better sphere!</p>

caught the cloud,<br />
And the torrent river sings aloud;<br />
The glacier-green Rosanna sings<br />
An organ song of its upper springs.<br />
Foaming under the tiers of pine,<br />
I see it dash down the dark ravine,<br />
And it tumbles the rocks in boisterous play,<br />
With an earnest will to find its way.<br />
Sharp it throws out an emerald shoulder,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And, thundering ever of the mountain,<br />
Slaps in sport some giant boulder,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And tops it in a silver fountain.<br />
A chain of foam from end to end,<br />
And a solitude so deep, my friend,<br />
You may forget that man abides<br />
Beyond the great mute mountain-sides.<br />
Yet to me, in this high-walled solitude<br />
Of river and rock and forest rude,<br />
The roaring voice through the long white chain<br />
Is the voice of the world of bubble and brain.</p>

I saw full many a market rose,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And sighed for my village lily.</p>

Bursts out like a reveller&rsquo;s loud in the night,<br />

<h3>III</h3>
<p class="poetry">We two were bound the Alps to scale,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Up the rock-reflecting river;<br />

<p class="poetry">Hawking ruin, wood-slope, and vine<br />

<p class="poetry">A young ballet-beauty, who perked in her

&nbsp;&nbsp; Look on quite grave:&mdash;the sunlight flecks his
side;<br />
And links of bindweed-flowers round him run,<br />

<p class="poetry">That isle o&rsquo; mud looks baking dry with
gold.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; His needle-muzzle still works out and in.<br />

<p class="poetry">And that&rsquo;s what my fine daughter
said:&mdash;she meant:<br />

<p class="poetry">But if I go and say to my old hen:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll mend the gentry&rsquo;s boots, and keep

Warmer and better.<br />

<p class="poetry">She suffered for me:&mdash;women, you&rsquo;ll

&nbsp;&nbsp; I saw beneath her shawl my old tea-can<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Trembling . . . she brought it<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To screw me for my work: she loath&rsquo;d my

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And therefore doubly kind I
thought it.</p>

<p class="poetry">I&rsquo;ve never lost the taste of that same

<h3>I</h3>
<p class="poetry">&lsquo;<span class="smcap">Heigh</span>,
boys!&rsquo; cried Grandfather Bridgeman, &lsquo;it&rsquo;s time
before dinner to-day.&rsquo;<br />
He lifted the crumpled letter, and thumped a surprising
&lsquo;Hurrah!&rsquo;<br />
Up jumped all the echoing young ones, but John, with the starch
in his throat,<br />
Said, &lsquo;Father, before we make noises, let&rsquo;s see the
contents of the note.&rsquo;<br />
The old man glared at him harshly, and twinkling made answer:
&lsquo;Too bad!<br />
John Bridgeman, I&rsquo;m always the whisky, and you are the
water, my lad!&rsquo;</p>
<h3>II</h3>
<p class="poetry">But soon it was known thro&rsquo; the house,
and the house ran over for joy,<br />
That news, good news, great marvels, had come from the soldier
boy;<br />
Young Tom, the luckless scapegrace, offshoot of Methodist
John;<br />
His grandfather&rsquo;s evening tale, whom the old man hailed as
his son.<br />
And the old man&rsquo;s shout of pride was a shout of his
victory, too;<br />
For he called his affection a method: the neighbours&rsquo;
opinions he knew.</p>
<h3><a name="page166"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
166</span>III</h3>
<p class="poetry">Meantime, from the morning table removing the
stout breakfast cheer,<br />
The drink of the three generations, the milk, the tea, and the
beer<br />
(Alone in its generous reading of pints stood the
Grandfather&rsquo;s jug),<br />
The women for sight of the missive came pressing to coax and to
hug.<br />
He scattered them quick, with a buss and a smack; thereupon he
began<br />
Diversions with John&rsquo;s little Sarah: on Sunday, the naughty
old man!</p>
<h3>IV</h3>
<p class="poetry">Then messengers sped to the maltster, the
auctioneer, miller, and all<br />
The seven sons of the farmer who housed in the range of his
call.<br />
Likewise the married daughters, three plentiful ladies, prime
cooks,<br />
Who bowed to him while they condemned, in meek hope to stand high
in his books.<br />
&lsquo;John&rsquo;s wife is a fool at a pudding,&rsquo; they
said, and the light carts up hill<br />
Went merrily, flouting the Sabbath: for puddings well made mend a
will.</p>
<h3>V</h3>
<p class="poetry">The day was a van-bird of summer: the robin
still piped, but the blue,<br />
As a warm and dreamy palace with voices of larks ringing
thro&rsquo;,<br />
<a name="page167"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 167</span>Looked
down as if wistfully eyeing the blossoms that fell from its
lap:<br />
A day to sweeten the juices: a day to quicken the sap.<br />
All round the shadowy orchard sloped meadows in gold, and the
dear<br />
Shy violets breathed their hearts out: the maiden breath of the
year!</p>
<h3>VI</h3>
<p class="poetry">Full time there was before dinner to bring
fifteen of his blood,<br />
To sit at the old man&rsquo;s table: they found that the dinner
was good.<br />
But who was she by the lilacs and pouring laburnums concealed,<br
/>
When under the blossoming apple the chair of the Grandfather
wheeled?<br />
She heard one little child crying, &lsquo;Dear brave Cousin
Tom!&rsquo; as it leapt;<br />
Then murmured she: &lsquo;Let me spare them!&rsquo; and passed
round the walnuts, and wept.</p>
<h3>VII</h3>
<p class="poetry">Yet not from sight had she slipped ere feminine
eyes could detect<br />
The figure of Mary Charlworth.&nbsp; &lsquo;It&rsquo;s just what
we all might expect,&rsquo;<br />
Was uttered: and: &lsquo;Didn&rsquo;t I tell you?&rsquo;&nbsp; Of
Mary the rumour resounds,<br />
That she is now her own mistress, and mistress of five thousand
pounds.<br />
&rsquo;Twas she, they say, who cruelly sent young Tom to the
war.<br />
Miss Mary, we thank you now!&nbsp; If you knew what we&rsquo;re
thanking you for!</p>
<h3><a name="page168"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
168</span>VIII</h3>
<p class="poetry">But, &lsquo;Have her in: let her hear
it,&rsquo; called Grandfather Bridgeman, elate,<br />
While Mary&rsquo;s black-gloved fingers hung trembling with
flight on the gate.<br />
Despite the women&rsquo;s remonstrance, two little ones, lighter
than deer,<br />
Were loosed, and Mary, imprisoned, her whole face white as a
tear,<br />
Came forward with culprit footsteps.&nbsp; Her punishment was to
commence:<br />
The pity in her pale visage they read in a different sense.</p>
<h3>IX</h3>
<p class="poetry">&lsquo;You perhaps may remember a fellow, Miss
Charlworth, a sort of black sheep,&rsquo;<br />
The old man turned his tongue to ironical utterance deep:<br />
&lsquo;He came of a Methodist dad, so it wasn&rsquo;t his fault
if he kicked.<br />
He earned a sad reputation, but Methodists are mortal strict.<br
/>
His name was Tom, and, dash me! but Bridgeman! I think you might
add:<br />
Whatever he was, bear in mind that he came of a Methodist
dad.&rsquo;</p>
<h3>X</h3>
<p class="poetry">This prelude dismally lengthened, till Mary,
starting, exclaimed,<br />
&lsquo;A letter, Sir, from your grandson?&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Tom
Bridgeman that rascal is named,&rsquo;<br />
<a name="page169"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 169</span>The old
man answered, and further, the words that sent Tom to the
ranks<br />
Repeated as words of a person to whom they all owed mighty
thanks.<br />
But Mary never blushed: with her eyes on the letter, she sate,<br
/>
And twice interrupting him faltered, &lsquo;The date, may I ask,
Sir, the date?&rsquo;</p>
<h3>XI</h3>
<p class="poetry">&lsquo;Why, that&rsquo;s what I never look at
in a letter,&rsquo; the farmer replied:<br />
&lsquo;Facts first! and now I&rsquo;ll be parson.&rsquo;&nbsp;
The Bridgeman women descried<br />
A quiver on Mary&rsquo;s eyebrows.&nbsp; One turned, and while
shifting her comb,<br />
Said low to a sister: &lsquo;I&rsquo;m certain she knows more
than we about Tom.<br />
She wants him now he&rsquo;s a hero!&rsquo;&nbsp; The same,
resuming her place,<br />
Begged Mary to check them the moment she found it a tedious
case.</p>
<h3>XII</h3>
<p class="poetry">Then as a mastiff swallows the snarling noises
of cats,<br />
The voice of the farmer opened.&nbsp; &lsquo;&ldquo;Three cheers,
and off with your hats!&rdquo;<br />
&mdash;That&rsquo;s Tom.&nbsp; &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve beaten them,
Daddy, and tough work it was, to be sure!<br />
A regular stand-up combat: eight hours smelling powder and
gore.<br />
I entered it Serjeant-Major,&rdquo;&mdash;and now he commands a
salute,<br />
And carries the flag of old England!&nbsp; Heigh! see him lift
foes on his foot!</p>
<h3><a name="page170"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
170</span>XIII</h3>
<p class="poetry">&lsquo;&mdash;An officer! ay, Miss Charlworth,
he is, or he is so to be;<br />
You&rsquo;ll own war isn&rsquo;t such humbug: and Glory means
something, you see.<br />
&ldquo;But don&rsquo;t say a word,&rdquo; he continues,
&ldquo;against the brave French any more.&rdquo;<br />
&mdash;That stopt me: we&rsquo;ll now march together.&nbsp; I
couldn&rsquo;t read further before.<br />
That &ldquo;brave French&rdquo; I couldn&rsquo;t stomach.&nbsp;
He can&rsquo;t see their cunning to get<br />
Us Britons to fight their battles, while best half the winnings
they net!&rsquo;</p>
<h3>XIV</h3>
<p class="poetry">The old man sneered, and read forward.&nbsp; It
was of that desperate fight;&mdash;<br />
The Muscovite stole thro&rsquo; the mist-wreaths that wrapped the
chill Inkermann height,<br />
Where stood our silent outposts: old England was in them that
day!<br />
O sharp worked his ruddy wrinkles, as if to the breath of the
fray<br />
They moved!&nbsp; He sat bareheaded: his long hair over him
slow<br />
Swung white as the silky bog-flowers in purple heath-hollows that
grow.</p>
<h3>XV</h3>
<p class="poetry">And louder at Tom&rsquo;s first person: acute
and in thunder the &lsquo;I&rsquo;<br />
Invaded the ear with a whinny of triumph, that seem&rsquo;d to
defy<br />
<a name="page171"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 171</span>The
hosts of the world.&nbsp; All heated, what wonder he little could
brook<br />
To catch the sight of Mary&rsquo;s demure puritanical look?<br />
And still as he led the onslaught, his treacherous side-shots he
sent<br />
At her who was fighting a battle as fierce, and who sat there
unbent.</p>
<h3>XVI</h3>
<p class="poetry">&lsquo;&ldquo;We stood in line, and like
hedgehogs the Russians rolled under us thick.<br />
They frightened me there.&rdquo;&mdash;He&rsquo;s no coward; for
when, Miss, they came at the quick,<br />
The sight, he swears, was a breakfast.&mdash;&ldquo;My stomach
felt tight: in a glimpse<br />
I saw you snoring at home with the dear cuddled-up little
imps.<br />
And then like the winter brickfields at midnight, hot fire
lengthened out.<br />
Our fellows were just leashed bloodhounds: no heart of the lot
faced about.</p>
<h3>XVII</h3>
<p class="poetry">&lsquo;&ldquo;And only that grumbler, Bob
Harris, remarked that we stood one to ten:<br />
&lsquo;Ye fool,&rsquo; says Mick Grady, &lsquo;just tell
&rsquo;em they know to compliment men!&rsquo;<br />
And I sang out your old words: &lsquo;If the opposite side
isn&rsquo;t God&rsquo;s,<br />
Heigh! after you&rsquo;ve counted a dozen, the pluckiest lads
have the odds.&rsquo;<br />
Ping-ping flew the enemies&rsquo; pepper: the Colonel roared,
Forward, and we<br />
Went at them.&nbsp; &rsquo;Twas first like a blanket: and then a
long plunge in the sea.</p>
<h3><a name="page172"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
172</span>XVIII</h3>
<p class="poetry">&lsquo;&ldquo;Well, now about me and the
Frenchman: it happened I can&rsquo;t tell you how:<br />
And, Grandfather, hear, if you love me, and put aside prejudice
now&rdquo;:<br />
He never says &ldquo;Grandfather&rdquo;&mdash;Tom
don&rsquo;t&mdash;save it&rsquo;s a serious thing.<br />
&ldquo;Well, there were some pits for the rifles, just dug on our
French-leaning wing:<br />
And backwards, and forwards, and backwards we went, and at last I
was vexed,<br />
And swore I would never surrender a foot when the Russians
charged next.</p>
<h3>XIX</h3>
<p class="poetry">&lsquo;&ldquo;I know that life&rsquo;s worth
keeping.&rdquo;&mdash;Ay, so it is, lad; so it is!&mdash;<br />
&ldquo;But my life belongs to a woman.&rdquo;&mdash;Does that
mean Her Majesty, Miss?&mdash;<br />
&ldquo;These Russians came lumping and grinning: they&rsquo;re
fierce at it, though they are blocks.<br />
Our fellows were pretty well pumped, and looked sharp for the
little French cocks.<br />
Lord, didn&rsquo;t we pray for their crowing! when over us, on
the hill-top,<br />
Behold the first line of them skipping, like kangaroos seen on
the hop.</p>
<h3>XX</h3>
<p class="poetry">&lsquo;&ldquo;That sent me into a passion, to
think of them spying our flight!&rdquo;<br />
Heigh, Tom! you&rsquo;ve Bridgeman blood, boy!&nbsp; And,
&ldquo;&lsquo;Face them!&rsquo; I shouted: &lsquo;All right;<br
/>
<a name="page173"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 173</span>Sure,
Serjeant, we&rsquo;ll take their shot dacent, like
gentlemen,&rsquo; Grady replied.<br />
A ball in his mouth, and the noble old Irishman dropped by my
side.<br />
Then there was just an instant to save myself, when a short
wheeze<br />
Of bloody lungs under the smoke, and a red-coat crawled up on his
knees.</p>
<h3>XXI</h3>
<p class="poetry">&lsquo;&ldquo;&rsquo;Twas Ensign Baynes of our
parish.&rdquo;&mdash;Ah, ah, Miss Charlworth, the one<br />
Our Tom fought for a young lady?&nbsp; Come, now we&rsquo;ve got
into the fun!&mdash;<br />
&ldquo;I shouldered him: he primed his pistol, and I trailed my
musket, prepared.&rdquo;<br />
Why, that&rsquo;s a fine pick-a-back for ye, to make twenty
Russians look scared!<br />
&ldquo;They came&mdash;never mind how many: we couldn&rsquo;t
have run very well,<br />
We fought back to back: &lsquo;face to face, our last
time!&rsquo; he said, smiling, and fell.</p>
<h3>XXII</h3>
<p class="poetry">&lsquo;&ldquo;Then I strove wild for his body:
the beggars saw glittering rings,<br />
Which I vowed to send to his mother.&nbsp; I got some hard knocks
and sharp stings,<br />
But felt them no more than angel, or devil, except in the
wind.<br />
I know that I swore at a Russian for showing his teeth, and he
grinned<br />
The harder: quick, as from heaven, a man on a horse rode
between,<br />
And fired, and swung his bright sabre: I can&rsquo;t write you
more of the scene.</p>
<h3><a name="page174"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
174</span>XXIII</h3>
<p class="poetry">&lsquo;&ldquo;But half in his arms, and half at
his stirrup, he bore me right forth,<br />
And pitched me among my old comrades: before I could tell south
from north,<br />
He caught my hand up, and kissed it!&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t ever let
any man speak<br />
A word against Frenchmen, I near him!&nbsp; I can&rsquo;t find
his name, tho&rsquo; I seek.<br />
But French, and a General, surely he was, and, God bless him!
thro&rsquo; him<br />
I&rsquo;ve learnt to love a whole nation.&rdquo;&rsquo;&nbsp; The
ancient man paused, winking dim.</p>
<h3>XXIV</h3>
<p class="poetry">A curious look, half woeful, was seen on his
face as he turned<br />
His eyes upon each of his children, like one who but faintly
discerned<br />
His old self in an old mirror.&nbsp; Then gathering sense in his
fist,<br />
He sounded it hard on his knee-cap.&nbsp; &lsquo;Your hand, Tom,
the French fellow kissed!<br />
He kissed my boy&rsquo;s old pounder!&nbsp; I say he&rsquo;s a
gentleman!&rsquo;&nbsp; Straight<br />
The letter he tossed to one daughter; bade her the remainder
relate.</p>
<h3>XXV</h3>
<p class="poetry">Tom properly stated his praises in facts, but
the lady preferred<br />
To deck the narration with brackets, and drop her additional
word.<br />
<a name="page175"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 175</span>What
nobler Christian natures these women could boast, who,
&rsquo;twas known,<br />
Once spat at the name of their nephew, and now made his praises
their own!<br />
The letter at last was finished, the hearers breathed freely, and
sign<br />
Was given, &lsquo;Tom&rsquo;s health!&rsquo;&mdash;Quoth the
farmer: &lsquo;Eh, Miss? are you weak in the spine?&rsquo;</p>
<h3>XXVI</h3>
<p class="poetry">For Mary had sunk, and her body was shaking, as
if in a fit.<br />
Tom&rsquo;s letter she held, and her thumb-nail the month when
the letter was writ<br />
Fast-dinted, while she hung sobbing: &lsquo;O, see, Sir, the
letter is old!<br />
O, do not be too happy!&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;If I understand you,
I&rsquo;m bowled!&rsquo;<br />
Said Grandfather Bridgeman, &lsquo;and down go my
wickets!&mdash;not happy! when here,<br />
Here&rsquo;s Tom like to marry his General&rsquo;s
daughter&mdash;or widow&mdash;I&rsquo;ll swear!</p>
<h3>XXVII</h3>
<p class="poetry">&lsquo;I wager he knows how to strut,
too!&nbsp; It&rsquo;s all on the cards that the Queen<br />
Will ask him to Buckingham Palace, to say what he&rsquo;s done
and he&rsquo;s seen.<br />
Victoria&rsquo;s fond of her soldiers: and she&rsquo;s got a nose
for a fight.<br />
If Tom tells a cleverish story&mdash;there is such a thing as a
knight!<br />
And don&rsquo;t he look roguish and handsome!&mdash;To see a girl
snivelling there&mdash;<br />
By George, Miss, it&rsquo;s clear that you&rsquo;re
jealous&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;I love him!&rsquo; she answered his
stare.</p>
<h3><a name="page176"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
176</span>XXVIII</h3>
<p class="poetry">&lsquo;Yes! now!&rsquo; breathed the voice of a
woman.&mdash;&lsquo;Ah! now!&rsquo; quiver&rsquo;d low the
reply.<br />
&lsquo;And &ldquo;now&rdquo;&rsquo;s just a bit too late, so
it&rsquo;s no use your piping your eye,&rsquo;<br />
The farmer added bluffly: &lsquo;Old Lawyer Charlworth was
rich;<br />
You followed his instructions in kicking Tom into the ditch.<br
/>
If you&rsquo;re such a dutiful daughter, that doesn&rsquo;t prove
Tom is a fool.<br />
Forgive and forget&rsquo;s my motto! and here&rsquo;s my grog
growing cool!&rsquo;</p>
<h3>XXIX</h3>
<p class="poetry">&lsquo;But, Sir,&rsquo; Mary faintly repeated:
&lsquo;for four long weeks I have failed<br />
To come and cast on you my burden; such grief for you always
prevailed!<br />
My heart has so bled for you!&rsquo;&nbsp; The old man burst on
her speech:<br />
&lsquo;You&rsquo;ve chosen a likely time, Miss! a pretty occasion
to preach!&rsquo;<br />
And was it not outrageous, that now, of all times, one should
come<br />
With incomprehensible pity!&nbsp; Far better had Mary been
dumb.</p>
<h3>XXX</h3>
<p class="poetry">But when again she stammered in this
bewildering way,<br />
The farmer no longer could bear it, and begged her to go, or to
stay,<br />
<a name="page177"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 177</span>But not
to be whimpering nonsense at such a time.&nbsp; Pricked by a
goad,<br />
&rsquo;Twas you who sent him to glory:&mdash;you&rsquo;ve come
here to reap what you sowed.<br />
Is that it?&rsquo; he asked; and the silence the elders preserved
plainly said,<br />
On Mary&rsquo;s heaving bosom this begging-petition was read.</p>
<h3>XXXI</h3>
<p class="poetry">And that it was scarcely a bargain that she who
had driven him wild<br />
Should share now the fruits of his valour, the women expressed,
as they smiled.<br />
The family pride of the Bridgemans was comforted; still, with
contempt,<br />
They looked on a monied damsel of modesty quite so exempt.<br />
&lsquo;O give me force to tell them!&rsquo; cried Mary, and even
as she spoke,<br />
A shout and a hush of the children: a vision on all of them

<p class="poetry">Wheeled, pale, in a chair, and shattered, the
wreck of their hero was seen;<br />
The ghost of Tom drawn slow o&rsquo;er the orchard&rsquo;s
shadowy green.<br />
Could this be the martial darling they joyed in a moment ago?<br

&lsquo;He knows it?&rsquo; to Mary Tom murmured, and closed his
weak lids at her &lsquo;No.&rsquo;<br />
&lsquo;Beloved!&rsquo; she said, falling by him, &lsquo;I have
been a coward: I thought<br />
You lay in the foreign country, and some strange good might be
wrought.</p>

failed, with my hand on the gate.<br />
I bore the dreadful knowledge, and crushed my heart with its
weight.<br />
The letter brought by your comrade&mdash;he has but just read it
aloud!<br />
It only reached him this morning!&rsquo;&nbsp; Her head on his

Then Tom with pity&rsquo;s tenderest lordliness patted her
arm,<br />
And eyed the old white-head fondly, with something of doubt and
alarm.</p>

<p class="poetry">O, take to your fancy a sculptor whose fresh
marble offspring appears<br />
Before him, shiningly perfect, the laurel-crown&rsquo;d issue of

Is heaven offended? for lightning behold from its bosom

He cannot love the ruins, till, feeling that ruins alone<br />
Are left, he loves them threefold.&nbsp; So passed the old

&lsquo;Heigh! what have we been about, Tom!&nbsp; Was this all a

He cried, and the letter forth-trembled.&nbsp; Tom told what the
cannon had done.<br />
Few present but ached to see falling those aged tears on his

<p class="poetry">Up lanes of the quiet village, and where the
mill-waters rush red<br />
Thro&rsquo; browning summer meadows to catch the sun&rsquo;s
crimsoning head,<br />

wife<br />
With one whom they wheel, alternate; whose delicate flush of new
life<br />
Is prized like the early primrose.&nbsp; Then shake his right

The old man fails never to tell you: &lsquo;You&rsquo;ve got the

fall their black descent,<br />
Our primal thunder tells: known is the pain<br />
Of music, that nigh throning wisdom went,<br />
And one false note cast wailful to the insane.<br />
Now seems the language heard of Love as rain<br />
To make a mire where fruitfulness was meant.<br />
The golden harp gives out a jangled strain,<br />
Too like revolt from heaven&rsquo;s Omnipotent.<br />
But listen in the thought; so may there come<br />
Conception of a newly-added chord,<br />
Commanding space beyond where ear has home.<br />
In labour of the trouble at its fount,<br />
Leads Life to an intelligible Lord<br />
The rebel discords up the sacred mount.</p>

wept with waking eyes:<br />
That, at his hand&rsquo;s light quiver by her head,<br />
The strange low sobs that shook their common bed<br />
Were called into her with a sharp surprise,<br />
And strangled mute, like little gaping snakes,<br />
Dreadfully venomous to him.&nbsp; She lay<br />
Stone-still, and the long darkness flowed away<br />
With muffled pulses.&nbsp; Then, as midnight makes<br />
Her giant heart of Memory and Tears<br />
Drink the pale drug of silence, and so beat<br />
Sleep&rsquo;s heavy measure, they from head to feet<br />
Were moveless, looking through their dead black years,<br />
By vain regret scrawled over the blank wall.<br />

Upon their marriage-tomb, the sword between;<br />
Each wishing for the sword that severs all.</p>

Her eyes were guilty gates, that let him in<br />
By shutting all too zealous for their sin:<br />
Each sucked a secret, and each wore a mask.<br />
But, oh, the bitter taste her beauty had!<br />
He sickened as at breath of poison-flowers:<br />
A languid humour stole among the hours,<br />
And if their smiles encountered, he went mad,<br />
And raged deep inward, till the light was brown<br />
Before his vision, and the world, forgot,<br />
Looked wicked as some old dull murder-spot.<br />
A star with lurid beams, she seemed to crown<br />
The pit of infamy: and then again<br />
He fainted on his vengefulness, and strove<br />
To ape the magnanimity of love,<br />
And smote himself, a shuddering heap of pain.</p>

Cold as a mountain in its star-pitched tent,<br />
Stood high Philosophy, less friend than foe:<br />

Auguste forgives her ere the tear is used.<br />

<p class="poetry">Love ere he bleeds, an eagle in high skies,<br

Has earth beneath his wings: from reddened eve<br />
He views the rosy dawn.&nbsp; In vain they weave<br />
The fatal web below while far he flies.<br />
But when the arrow strikes him, there&rsquo;s a change.<br />
He moves but in the track of his spent pain,<br />
Whose red drops are the links of a harsh chain,<br />
Binding him to the ground, with narrow range.<br />
A subtle serpent then has Love become.<br />
I had the eagle in my bosom erst:<br />
Henceforward with the serpent I am cursed.<br />

You must bear all the venom of his tooth!</p>

<p class="poetry">Such a she who&rsquo;ll match with me?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In flying or pursuing,<br />
Subtle wiles are in her smiles<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To set the world a-wooing.<br />
She is steadfast as a star,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And yet the maddest maiden:<br />
She can wage a gallant war,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And give the peace of Eden.</p>

&nbsp;&nbsp; Eyes her young offspring, Day.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The birds are dreamily piping.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And O, my love, my darling!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The night is life ebb&rsquo;d
away:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Away beyond our reach!<br />
A sea that has cast us pale on the beach;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Weeds with the weeds and the pebbles<br />
That hear the lone tamarisk rooted in sand<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<h2>UNKNOWN FAIR FACES</h2>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">Though</span> I am faithful
to my loves lived through,<br />
And place them among Memory&rsquo;s great stars,<br />
Where burns a face like Hesper: one like Mars:<br />
Of visages I get a moment&rsquo;s view,<br />
Sweet eyes that in the heaven of me, too,<br />
Ascend, tho&rsquo; virgin to my life they passed.<br />
Lo, these within my destiny seem glassed<br />
At times so bright, I wish that Hope were new.<br />
A gracious freckled lady, tall and grave,<br />
Went, in a shawl voluminous and white,<br />
Last sunset by; and going sow&rsquo;d a glance.<br />
Earth is too poor to hold a second chance;<br />
I will not ask for more than Fortune gave:<br />
My heart she goes from&mdash;never from my sight!</p>

<p class="poetry">O <span class="smcap">my</span> lover! the
night like a broad smooth wave<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Bears us onward, and morn, a black rock, shines
wet.<br />
How I shuddered&mdash;I knew not that I was a slave,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Till I looked on thy face:&mdash;then I writhed in
the net.<br />
Then I felt like a thing caught by fire, that her star<br />
Glowed dark on the bosom of Shemselnihar.</p>
<p class="poetry">And he came, whose I am: O my lover! he
came:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And his slave, still so envied of women, was I:<br

And I turned as a hissing leaf spits from the flame,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Yes, I shrivelled to dust from him, haggard and
dry.<br />
O forgive her:&mdash;she was but as dead lilies are:<br />
The life of her heart fled from Shemselnihar.</p>
<p class="poetry">Yet with thee like a full throbbing rose how I
bloom!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Like a rose by the fountain whose showering we
hear,<br />
As we lie, O my lover! in this rich gloom,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Smelling faint the cool breath of the lemon-groves
near.<br />
As we lie gazing out on that glowing great star&mdash;<br />
Ah! dark on the bosom of Shemselnihar.</p>
<p class="poetry">Yet with thee am I not as an arm of the
vine,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Firm to bind thee, to cherish thee, feed thee
sweet?<br />
Swear an oath on my lip to let none disentwine<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The life that here fawns to give warmth to thy
feet.<br />
I on thine, thus! no more shall that jewelled Head jar<br />
The music thou breathest on Shemselnihar.</p>

There my kindred abide in their green and blue tents:<br />

Let us slip down the stream and leap steed till afar<br />
None question thy claim upon Shemselnihar.</p>
<p class="poetry">O that long note the bulbul gave
out&mdash;meaning love!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; O my lover, hark to him and think it my voice!<br />
The blue night like a great bell-flower from above<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Drooping low and gold-eyed: O, but hear him
rejoice!<br />
Can it be?&nbsp; &rsquo;twas a flash! that accurst
scimit&agrave;r<br />
In thought even cuts thee from Shemselnihar.</p>
<p class="poetry">Yes, I would that, less generous, he would
oppress,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; He would chain me, upbraid me, burn deep brands for
hate,<br />
Than with this mask of freedom and gorgeousness<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Bespangle my slavery, mock my strange fate.<br />
Would, would, would, O my lover, he knew&mdash;dared debar<br />
Thy coming, and earn curse of Shemselnihar!</p>

Of human passions, but of love deflowered<br />

Thence came the honeyed corner at his lips,<br />
The conquering smile wherein his spirit sails<br />
Calm as the God who the white sea-wave whips,<br />
Yet full of speech and intershifting tales,<br />
Close mirrors of us: thence had he the laugh<br />
We feel is thine: broad as ten thousand beeves<br />
At pasture! thence thy songs, that winnow chaff<br />
From grain, bid sick Philosophy&rsquo;s last leaves<br />
Whirl, if they have no response&mdash;they enforced<br />
To fatten Earth when from her soul divorced.</p>

Which moved some weighty leader of the blind,<br />
Unwitting &rsquo;twas the goad of personal pain,<br />
To view in curst eclipse our Mother&rsquo;s mind,<br />
And show us of some rigid harridan<br />
The wretched bondmen till the end of time.<br />

TO THE SPIRIT OF EARTH IN AUTUMN</h2>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">Fair</span> Mother Earth
lay on her back last night,<br />
To gaze her fill on Autumn&rsquo;s sunset skies,<br />
When at a waving of the fallen light<br />
Sprang realms of rosy fruitage o&rsquo;er her eyes.<br />
A lustrous heavenly orchard hung the West,<br />
Wherein the blood of Eden bloomed again:<br />
Red were the myriad cherub-mouths that pressed,<br />
Among the clusters, rich with song, full fain,<br />
But dumb, because that overmastering spell<br />
Of rapture held them dumb: then, here and there,<br />
A golden harp lost strings; a crimson shell<br />
Burnt grey; and sheaves of lustre fell to air.<br />
The illimitable eagerness of hue<br />
Bronzed, and the beamy winged bloom that flew<br />
&rsquo;Mid those bunched fruits and thronging figures failed.<br
/>
A green-edged lake of saffron touched the blue,<br />
With isles of fireless purple lying through:<br />
And Fancy on that lake to seek lost treasures sailed.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not long
the silence followed:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The voice that issues from thy breast,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; O glorious South-west,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Along the gloom-horizon holloa&rsquo;d;<br />
Warning the valleys with a mellow roar<br />
Through flapping wings; then sharp the woodland bore<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; A shudder and a noise of hands:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; A thousand horns from some far vale<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In ambush sounding on the gale.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Forth from the cloven sky came bands<br />
<a name="page255"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 255</span>Of
revel-gathering spirits; trooping down,<br />
Some rode the tree-tops; some on torn cloud-strips<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Burst screaming thro&rsquo; the lighted town:<br />
And scudding seaward, some fell on big ships:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Or mounting the sea-horses blew<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Bright foam-flakes on the black review<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Of heaving hulls and burying beaks.</p>
<p class="poetry">Still on the farthest line, with outpuffed
cheeks,<br />
&rsquo;Twixt dark and utter dark, the great wind drew<br />
From heaven that disenchanted harmony<br />
To join earth&rsquo;s laughter in the midnight blind:<br />
Booming a distant chorus to the shrieks<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Preluding him: then he,<br />
His mantle streaming thunderingly behind,<br />
Across the yellow realm of stiffened Day,<br />
Shot thro&rsquo; the woodland alleys signals three;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And with the pressure of a sea<br />
Plunged broad upon the vale that under lay.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Night on the rolling foliage
fell:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; But I, who love old hymning night,<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp; Like souls to wander after death:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Great armies in imperial dyes,<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp; To taste before they rot.&nbsp; And here,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Like frail white-bodied girls in fear,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The birches swung from shrieks to sighs;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The aspens, laughers at a breath,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In showering spray-falls mixed their cries,<br />

Deep Peace below upon the muffled sod,<br />

And multitudes, acclaiming to the cloud,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Cry which is breaking, which is bowed.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Away, for the cymbals clash

Very well, thank you, Martin!&mdash;I can&rsquo;t understand!<br

I can&rsquo;t understand it.&nbsp; She talks like a song;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Her voice takes your ear like the ring of a
glass;<br />
She seems to give gladness while limping along,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Yet sinner ne&rsquo;er suffer&rsquo;d like that
little lass.</p>
<h3>II</h3>
<p class="poetry">First, a fool of a boy ran her down with a
cart.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Then, her fool of a father&mdash;a blacksmith by
trade&mdash;<br />
Why the deuce does he tell us it half broke his heart?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; His heart!&mdash;where&rsquo;s the leg of the poor

&nbsp;&nbsp; It&rsquo;s the very same lesson we get from the
Book.<br />
Then, is Life but a trial?&nbsp; Is that what is meant?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Some must toil, and some perish, for others
below:<br />

tools.<br />
It&rsquo;s a roundabout way, with respect let me add,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; If Molly goes crippled that we may be taught:<br />
But, perhaps, it&rsquo;s the only way, though it&rsquo;s so
bad;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In that case we&rsquo;ll bow down our
heads,&mdash;as we ought.</p>

<p class="poetry">But the worst of <i>me</i> is, that when I bow
my head,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; I perceive a thought wriggling away in the dust,<br

&nbsp;&nbsp; Of humble acceptance: for, question I must!<br />
Here&rsquo;s a creature made carefully&mdash;carefully made!<br

&nbsp;&nbsp; Put together with craft, and then stamped on, and
why?<br />
The answer seems nowhere: it&rsquo;s discord that&rsquo;s
played.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The sky&rsquo;s a blue dish!&mdash;an implacable
sky!</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this

electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it

  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this

  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm

additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org 

Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary 
Archive Foundation

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
